    <p class="fade-on-scroll center grey-text text-lighten-3 flow-text">Knack at Western consists is an event that lets students run workshops that give handson training on a tangible, new skill.</p>

    <p class="fade-on-scroll center grey-text text-lighten-3 flow-text">The flip side is that students have the opportunity to attend these workshops throughout the event.</p>

    <blockquote class="flow-text grey-text text-lighten-3">
      We want to create more of a 'Maker' culture at Western and provide a learning experience which is unlike anything you can find in a classroom.
