          <p class="grey-text light text-lighten-2">This workshop is run by students for students. It consists of sessions running anywhere from one to two hours. Your audience will get hands-on training for a new skill. Teaching at Knack at Western will give you first-hand exposure to running workshops, public speaking, but most importantly, conveying new concepts and skills to your cohorts. We will provide the space, time, audience and even materials needed for your workshop session. Your only job is to make sure that you leave your peers with a new skill and have fun sharing your knowledge.</p>
